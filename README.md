# CvssDataSet
This dataset used the NVD database, which offers the most reliable vulnerability data for research use.   There are approximately 158,059 vulnerabilities published so far in the current NVD dataset.The dataset used in this study was created from 156,096 records published through 2021 (31.12.2020). Although there is a technical explanation of the security vulnerability in all records, not all records contain official security vector values and severity scores. The total number of records with CVSS 2.0 vectors from existing records is 147,275. The number of records with CVSS 3.1 vector values is 73,907. Therefore, when applying our methodology, data without official values were removed.
